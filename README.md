 Keyboard trainer
 
 The source code was written in 2005 while I was studying at Modern University for the Humanities. During the development of the program, Shahijanyan 's analog program "Solo on Keyboard" was studied.
The program is intended to carry out practical trainings on learning the set on the keyboard of individual letters and numbers, words and sentences using the register of input of capital and lower letters. Training is divided into 3 levels which in turn consist of tasks. You can modify the content of tasks by editing the ini file using any text editor.
The output of the program is a numerical estimate of the speed and number of errors in typing. This information is temporary and is not stored longer than the task time.
The program supports multi-user mode by tracking the performance of each user (trainee). Information about the trainee, data about the achieved level and the job number are saved in the ini-file and initialized from this file by entering the user name and password, which are requested when the program starts or the trainee changes.
